Assignment to Build a Basic Heater Control System

Components Used :-
1. Arduino UNO
2. Analog Temperature Sensor
3. Relay Module
4. LED

Future Roadmaps:_
Project Roadmap: Smart Heater Control System
Goals:
•	Build and test a basic heater control system using a temperature sensor 
•	Use LED to simulate heater ON/OFF
•	Implement hysteresis control logic

•	Breadboard, Temperature Sensor, LED, resistors
•	Serial Monitor for debugging

Enhancements
Features to Add:
•	16x2 LCD/OLED display to show temperature and heater state
•	Buzzer alert for overheating
•	Switch to ESP32/ESP8266 microcontroller
•	Build web server for:
o	Monitoring temperature remotely
o	Dynamic threshold control
o	Manual heater control
•	Basic mobile app 
•	Remote control & monitoring
•	Notifications (heater status, overheat alerts)

Communication Protocol Used :-  UART
